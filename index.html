You are the prettiest girl in the world and you deserve every bit of my love. And I am so sorry for hurting you this much. You are truly the best thing that life has ever offered to me and I will not let it go that easily, this temporary seperation will not stop me from going after you, I know I can be annoying at times when you just want a break but I really really want you in my life. I love you a lot and you mean so much to me, I want to be able to share my experiences with you whether it be good or bad. I want to be able to share my ice cream with you, I want to give you all of my Canes toast and fries, I want to cry together when we argue, I want to hold your hands in the car, I want to go rock climbing with you, I want to celebrate my birthdays with you, I want to turn my dreams into reality together with you. I want you in my life, so please, forgive me. I am sorry. I have been thinking about us every single day, and I have made my decision... to be with you. Until my very last breath. I love you a lot and I hope you can say the same. I love you.')">Yes</button>
